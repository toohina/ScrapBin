        <h2>To Whom We Provide Our Services And How</h2>
        <p>We are a Scrap Buying Company, where you can sell your scrap. We do this by categorising our customers into 3 sub groups: The One Time Seller
            , The Registered Non- Environmentalist sellers and The Environmentalist sellers. You can also become a scrap seller by just filling our form.
            We also display the upcycled products that are simply the products we made after recycling the scrap you sell to us. You can buy these 
            products using the points you earn by selling your waste to us. All you have to do is select the amount and type of waste you want to sell and the details.  <br>
            If you are a company that buys scrap and different types of waste products, you can tie up with us and buy the waste from our sellers through us.
             To become our partner, you just have to give us your details and we will reach out to you later.

        <h2>Who Are They and What Benefits Do They Enjoy</h2>
        <p>The One Time Sellers are the one who can request pickup without registering in our website. People who are generally in a hurry or do not spend much time
            in the process can become One Time Sellers. However, these type of sellers won't be enjoying any benefits our company provides: They would not
            be getting any points for every selling they make and they cannot buy our upcycled products. They would have to enter their address everytime they come on website.
             To enjoy such benefits they would have to register but there is no compulsion.

        <h2>Who Are They And The Benefits They Enjoy</h2>
        <p>The Registered sellers are those who register themselves on our website, login and submit their details such as address. This saves them the time it takes
            to fill the details again and again in the request pickup. They can also update their address and other details on their profile page. They also 
            get points everytime they sell their waste to us. Using those points they can buy the upcycled products that we display.

        <h2>Who are They And The Benefits They Enjoy</h2>
        <p> Environmentalists are the type of customers who will donate their scrap to us, that is, Environmentalists give us their waste without taking cash from us. 
            By doing so, they get a lot of points. A lot more points than what a regular Registered Seller gets. Using these points they can buy upcycled 
            products that are displayed on our website. <br>To become an Environmentalist one must just choose the option Environmentalist on the website while
            registering or if  they are already registered and want to change their profile into Environmentalist they can just do it by going to their profile and user settings.

           the company information in form and we will contact them later and let them know of the further course of action.
